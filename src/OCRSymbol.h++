  // Get the bounding boxes for the symbol.
  //
  // A bounding box exactly bounds the symbol, meaning it has no whitespace at
  // the edges.  The pixels at x and y of the rectangle are included. The
  // pixels at (x + width - 1) and (y + height - 1) are included as well.  The
  // pixels at (x + width) and (y + height) are outside the bounding box and
  // not part of the symbol.
  //
  // The returned bounding box is not necessarily the same as the one
  // originally returned by OCR.  The bounding boxes returned by Tesseract are
  // unreliable or even assigned to the wrong symbol.  The algorithm that has
  // assigned the returned bounding box does its best to detect invalid bounding
  // boxes. If possible it replaces them by valid bounding boxes determined
  // with OpenCV's contour detection algorithm.
  //
  // About the returned vector:
  //
  // - In most cases, there is only one bounding box in the returned vector.
  //   If so, it is usually reliable.
  //
  // - If there are no bounding boxes in the returned vector, this usually
  //   means that OCR has interpreted spacing between symbols and words
  //   differently than the algorithm that assigns bounding boxes.
  //
  //   Sometimes this indicates that OCR has mis-identified some symbols.
  //   Sometimes the spacing between symbols and/or words is too hard to
  //   interpret for the algorithm that assigns bounding boxes.
  //
  // - If there are multiple bounding boxes in the returned vector, this can
  //   be caused by symbols of which the pixels touch, causing bounding boxes
  //   that are too large and bound multiple symbols.
  //
  //   This sometimes makes it hard to determine which bounding box is for
  //   which symbol in a word.  The algorithm tries its best to determine
  //   anyway, and can split such bounding boxes and repair the situation.
  //   It just is not successful in every case, sometimes leaving multiple
  //   options open.
  //
  //   Having multiple bounding boxes is not useful for italic detection, but
  //   is very useful for debugging and improving the algorithm that assigns
  //   them.

  // 2. Build statistics about word spacing, symbol spacing, symbol bounding
  //    boxes and and ohter symbol properties.
  // 3. Remove all assigned bounding boxes with this method.
  // 4. Assign bounding boxes as best as possible to all symbols based on:
  //    - OCR symbol bounding boxes
  //    - OCR word bounding boxes
  //    - bounding boxes determined with OpenCV contour detection,
  //    - the collected statistics.

  // Algorithm:
  // - Take at position A of first black pixel in top row of bbox.
  // - Take at position B of first black pixel in bottom row of bbox.

  // - Method build_stats has already collected C for each symbol with a
  //   reliable bounding box.  The resulting TextStats have information about
  //   the minimum, average and maximum C value for each distinct symbol.
  // - Retrieve the average rel_dist value D for a symbol from the TextStats.
  // - Take E = C - D. if > 0, likely italic. If not, likely not italic.
  // - Do the same for the last pixel in top and bottom row.
  // - The greater the difference, the more confident (up to a point, then
  //   it's likely unreliable information such as a mis-identified symbol,
  //   or an unreliable bounding box).
  // 
  // This works well as long as the same font is used throughout the subtitles.
  //
  // Also:
  // - don't calculate italic confidence for:
  //   - some punctuation symbols that don't give reliable results
  //   - a symbol with a likely invalid bbox for the symbol, based on the
  //     statistics (could be a symbol mis-identified by OCR).
  //   - symbols without a bbox.
